<h2> introduction</h2>
<p>The "html window editor" is a lay-out tool for designing HTML pages and windows. 
The generated HTML output has absolute positioned elements. 
With this approach, windows with a fixed lay-out can be embedded in your application. 
An example are the file open and file save windows, used in this program. The source file for this is dialoghtml.src.<br>
<br>
This application is build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Because writing to files is not supported in standard browsers, a Node.js server is used for file i/o.
<br> 
<br>
In the editor, the following elements can be selected, placed an resized: 
<br>
<br>
<table id="table">
<tr>
<td>box</td>
<td>A box is a HTML DIV element. It forms the base element where other elements, including the box element, can be placed upon.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>label</td>
<td>A label is also a HTML DIV element. It is intended for displaying text. It is not possible to add child elements.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>input field</td>
<td>HTML INPUT element with type="text". </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>button</td>
<td>HTML INPUT element with type="button". </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>checkbox</td>
<td>HTML INPUT element with type="checkbox". </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>select element</td>
<td>A HTML SELECT element. Select &lt;OPTION&gt; elements must be added with user defined JavaScript. </td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>image element</td>
<td>A HTML IMG element.</td>
</tr>

</table>
<br> 
The output of the editor is a HTML file. Elements have an id and class attribute. A style attribute defines position and size. 
Up to four additional attributes can be defined. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>installation and starting</h2>
Node.js must be installed on your machine. See https://nodejs.org/ for details. Unzip the install file in a directory of your choice. 
Start the node.js server in a command window by typing "node server". 
To start the application, enter the address "localhost:3250" in your browser. 
</p>
<p>
<h2>using</h2>
<img src='screen.gif'><br><br>
In the top of the screen you will find the menu bar. The file menu has selections for 'new', 'open', 'save' and 'html output'. <br><br>
Below that is a tool bar for choosing the html element to be placed. <br> <br>
Start with placing a base box for containing your elements. Then, add elements, such as box, label and input fields. 
A selected element is marked with a blue outline. Selected elements can be moved and resized.<br><br>
The left pane shows the properties of the selected element, in this case an input element for a directory name.
<br>As an example, the output HTML for the selected element in the image is:<font color="blue">
<br> 
&lt;input type="text" id="opendialogdir" class="edit" style="left:36px;top:31px;width:411px;height:20px" 
onblur="openDialogBlur('dir')" onkeyup="openDialogKeyUp(event)" value=""&gt; </font>
<br><br>
When completed, save your file and generate an output HTML file with the "html output" function in the file menu. 
<br>
The output can be embedded as HTML in your application. 
Please note that a CSS definition "position:absolute" is required for all elements.
